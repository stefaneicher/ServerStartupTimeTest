= Starting a server is complicated, takes long and I can't start the app in a test -> No, no , no


Have you ever heard people saying that starting you server is complicated?
Or that it takes a long time to start the server?
Or have you seen astonished faces as you proposed to start the server before this test case?

It sees as this is a common perception and the answer to this is *No, no, no*


= Complicated

= Takes long

It is not the server, it's your application!
What is the starting of a server realy?  Isn't it just getting a port and loading of some classes in a jar
(for jetty 6Mb 3 MB for tomcat)
